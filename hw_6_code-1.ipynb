    " Your task is to predict whether a news article is real or fake using the available information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that you'll use can be downloaded from and is described at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset as well as the following references:\n",
    "\n",
    "You will probably get the most informative information from the content of the articles as well as their titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTE**: You _must_ remove the news agency names from the articles.  For example, if an article is from Reuters, you should remove the word \"Reuters\" from the article.  This is because the news agency name is a very strong indicator of whether an article is real or fake, and we want you to focus on the content of the article itself.  You can use the following code similar to the following to remove the news agency names:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "def remove_news_agency_name(text):\n",
    "    return re.sub(r\"Reuters|AP|New York Times|Washington Post|Business Insider|Atlantic|Fox News|National Review|Talking Points Memo|Buzzfeed News|Guardian|NPR|Vox|CNN|BBC|Bloomberg|Daily Mail\", \"\", text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You have at your disposal several\n",
    "techniques that you can use to create features from text, including, word embedding, part-of-speech analysis (from SI 330), and so on.  You might want to use CountVectorizer and/or TfidfVectorizer from the\n",
    "sklearn.feature_extraction library, which are described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You should pre-process your text using at least some of the steps outlined in lectures (e.g. normalizing to lowercase, splitting into words, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The articles are provided in two different files: Fake.csv and True.csv.  We recommend that you create a dataframe with the contents of those files combined, including a new column that specifies whether the article is real or fake (note that you can use whatever coding you want for \"real\" vs. \"fake\", e.g. 1 and 0, \"real\" and \"fake\", \"false\" and \"true\" -- whatever works for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You should split the resulting combined dataframe into training and testing datasets OR use cross-validation.  If you go the splitting-into-training-and-testing route, we recommend an 80-20 split (i.e. training gets 80% of the data; testing gets 20%) and use the testing dataset to report your accuracy score.  If you go the cross-validation route, we recommend using 5-fold cross-validation and use the mean accuracy score for your 5 folds when reporting your accuracy score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like the previous homework assignment, you'll want to try a variety of classifiers and possibly use an ensemble.  And, in a similar way to the previous homework assignment, your submission (to Canvas -- there is no requirement to submit this anywhere else, including Kaggle) should be based on a Jupyter notebook that you create.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. As as final challenge, we would like you to attempt to characterize each of the datasets in terms of their semantic content.  This might involve extracting the most commonly occurring words (possibly limiting that to specific parts of speech), examining the Named Entities, and extracting keywords by leveraging word embeddings.  Use your imagination, and remember there is no single \"correct\" answer.  For those of you looking to teach yourself something new, check out Latent Dirichilet Allocation (LDA) using the `gensim` library.  To get started with LDA, check out https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/topic-modeling-gensim-python/ and https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldamodel.html.  You are not required to use LDA, but it is a powerful technique for extracting topics from text.\n"
